# Snooker Scoring Web Application

A web-based application for tracking scores in snooker matches. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, this app provides an intuitive interface for two players to track their snooker game scores, breaks, and frame wins.

## üé± Rules of Snooker
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

Snooker is played on a large table where players must pot balls in a specific order:
1. Red balls must be potted first (1 point each)
2. After each red, players can choose any colored ball (which is returned to its spot)
3. Once all reds are gone, colored balls must be potted in order:
   - Yellow (2 points)
   - Green (3 points)
   - Brown (4 points)
   - Blue (5 points)
   - Pink (6 points)
   - Black (7 points)

Players accumulate points through "breaks" (consecutive successful shots). The player with the most points wins the frame, and matches are typically played as "best of" a certain number of frames.

Fouls result in penalty points being awarded to the opponent, ranging from 4 to 7 points depending on the circumstances.
